# CallReminder
The App Idea:
Have you ever lost someone you care about because you forgot to call them as promised? It's a terrible feeling that nobody wants to experience. But now, with our amazing app, you'll never forget an important call again! Our app takes the responsibility of reminding you about all your important calls in a professional and efficient way.

Not only that, but our app also saves all your important numbers as emergency contacts so that you can always access them quickly in case of an emergency. Have you ever lost your childhood SIM card because you didn't use it for a few months, and it got deactivated as per the agreement with your telecom company? Well, our app can help prevent that from happening again by reminding you to make a call or send a message to keep it active.

Furthermore, our app has an amazing feature that allows you to track your call history for all your starred contacts. You can view the duration of the call, the start and end time, and even add notes about the conversation. Say goodbye to the hassle of manually keeping track of your calls and let our app do all the work for you. Try it out now and experience the convenience and peace of mind that comes with it!
